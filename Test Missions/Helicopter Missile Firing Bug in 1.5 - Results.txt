You asked me to be more specific, well, find the following test results.

I've made test cases with 3 helicopters, in 3 battle field scenarios, testing 3 different engagement types for each helicopter type.

Helicopters:
- KA-50
- MI-24V
- MI-28N

- Tanks Activated, SAMs activated, Not moving.
- Tanks Activated, SAMs activated, moving.

For each combination, find below the test results table. The results document:
- Effectivity (+++ = very good, --- = very bad)
- Missiles firec = How many missiles were fired in 10 minutes of flight
- Time and Frequency = How long till firing first missile, and how frequent missiles were fired.
